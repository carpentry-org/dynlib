# C and Carp

To make the example work, you’ll first have to build a shared library, using
`make lib` (if you want to learn how to do that I encourage you to look at the
Makefile, it’s very simple).

Once that is done, you should be able to run the example using either `make app`
or the more familiar `carp -x examples.carp`. It will do all the heavy lifting
from there!
